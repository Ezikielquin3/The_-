Documentation on getting our website to be deployed live on internet for public using this domain
   https://achesonathletics.com
First went to google domains and bought< .com > for $12 for Achesonathletics 
Followed this YouTube tutorial with some tweaks to it along the way https://youtu.be/VTltcz0l5Ho

1.	Login into firebase console for project console 
2.	Go to hosting function 
3.	Go to Add custom domain 
4.	Type in purchased domain achsesonathletics.com
5.	Verify address 
6.	Then in the Quick Set up copy record type and value from that window
7.	Go back to Google domains 	
    a.	Go into DNS 
    b.	Manage a custom record 
    c.	For Host name enter achesonathletics.com, then for record type put in A, then for data put in the value copied over from firebase 
    d.	Save 

Now within the VS code console got into Terminal -- Make sure you use a GitBash Terminal 
    Any team memeber within project gitbash terminal put in ---- firebase deploy
        Firebase will scan in all files in public folder and deploy it to the hosting site on project 
        We originally had an issue with how the deploy was reading in files because it wasnâ€™t  referencing our Dump folder(public folder) properly 




                //How I fixed our view referencing:
                I just deleted the /dump/ reference because the code was looking for /dump/ within /dump/. The reference was too broad and so it didn't work
                the same applies to /views/
