First make sure you have node installed, it is app that allows VS code to understand github commannds 

In the terminal in your vs code make sure you run code through git bash terminal ( found less errors in this terminal instead of normal one 

The rest is code and in parathesisis it is remarks on the code 

npm install firebase 

firebase Login (Check yes if you want to proceed)

Also found in the firebase console this is going to be handy later on in the process when trying to implement databse features under project settings this sdk with alot of project information

// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const analytics = getAnalytics(app);

The same applies to /views/
