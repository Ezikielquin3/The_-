    "content": "It's finally here after long last! This project has definitely had its ups and downs, but I couldn't be prouder of our team here at The_:. Although we have had to drastically reduce our scale, especially in the ''user account'' oriented features, I think we ended up pulling through with a pretty feature-packed website. Bu and Zeke worked tremendously hard to get the user database in a functional state the entire development period, and that alone I think requires commendation. Kyle was a great team member, always asking the important questions, and building a robust badge system, even if it isn't fully implemented into the database as of writing. Blaine, our project sponsor, also put a tremendous amount of leg-work in, writing 90% of all scripts used in our videos and being the star of the show. Overall, I couldn't ask for a better team. -Thomas Avinger, Web Developer "},

    "content": "Hello! Its me again here to rant about how this took longer than it should have. Regardless, I'm glad that the end result turned out to be a perfect copy of my vision. Shoutout to Zeke for reccomending this feature to be implemented. The page definitely needed a function like this, especially as our video catalog grows in size over our website's lifespan. Okay, lets talk about how to use them! They're pretty simple. Each button correlates with a muscle category. Click the button that correlates with the category you want to see. The page will reload, only showing those videos. You can also click the ''Video Catalog'' button at the top to reset the page to show all videos again. Ok, that's all for now. I'll let you know when I add more buttons to the site."},
